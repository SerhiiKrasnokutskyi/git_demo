I always say, I always say that it's the last time
A promise I can't keep
I always say I'll get a grip and it'll be fine
But I lie straight through my teeth (I lie straight through my teeth)
And though I try and do it right with my intentions
Keep them good, they never break, but I still bend 'em
'Cause this devil on my shoulder wants to pull me underneath (underneath)

Another sleepless night
Staring through the ceiling
I'm wondering how could I
Calm my head? Yeah
Calm my head 'cause

I see red
My blood is boiling and it shows
When all you are is a weapon (weapon)
You shoot 'em down 'til you end up alone
I seem fine
But I can't take the highs and the lows
All I am is a weapon (weapon)
I shoot 'em down 'til I end up alone
