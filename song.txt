I always say, I always say that it's the last time
A promise I can't keep
I always say I'll get a grip and it'll be fine
But I lie straight through my teeth (I lie straight through my teeth)
And though I try and do it right with my intentions
Keep them good, they never break, but I still bend 'em
'Cause this devil on my shoulder wants to pull me underneath (underneath)
